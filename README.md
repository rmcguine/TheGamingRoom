- Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The client, The Gaming Room, asked Creative Technology Solutions ("CTS") to create a web-based gaming app for multiple platforms. The app, based on their existing Android game "Draw It or Lose It," needed several features: ensuring only one game instance in memory at a time, unique and searchable game and team names, support for multiple players per team, and the ability to include multiple teams in a single game session.

- What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I believe that I did a well enough job summarizing -- as opposed to over-explaining -- the details as they pertained to the sections involved. For example, I tried to utilize bullet points as often as I could in order to draw attention to the important points, as opposed to "a wall of text" you may find in other forms of documentation. 

- What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

I think just having a regimented and deliberate approach towards developing the code was extremely beneficial to me. The tempation to just get in and start coding right away is something that I struggle with; and while it may be fine for a passion project or something that I'm working on for myself, I can appreciate the necessity a design document in a team and/or professional setting. The design document process allowed for an organized and reflective path towards creating the software.

- If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

Looking back on my work, I think I could have done a better job of explicitly giving a recommendation rather than observing the strengths and weaknesses of each option. While some clients may want more of a thoroughly researched report to provide a "TL;DR" scope of choices, the client here was looking for more specific guidance on which system design elements and choices they should go with for their application.

- How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I understood the user's requirements for Draw It or Lose It, aiming to ensure a uniform user experience, simplicity, and robust security for their information. Prioritizing user needs is crucial since they are the primary consumers of the product. If users are dissatisfied or have a poor experience, they may choose not to engage, purchase, or show interest in future products from the same company. Outside of just software functionality, users may have unique requirements depending on their business vertical (healthcare, government, financial, etc.) that can have devistating financial and legal ramifications if certain designs are not implemented properly. 

- How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

My main goal in designing the software was to fulfill the client's requirements and create comprehensive documentation. By documenting the code thoroughly, I aimed to ensure its adaptability for future applications. This approach simplifies understanding for both myself and other developers, clarifying the functionality of each code component and how it can be leveraged to meet specific requirements.
